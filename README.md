- 👋 Hi, I’m @overgroun
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting people have experience in DAOs 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning logistics of DAOs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a DAO called RemittDAO. The goal is to build wealth in the world's poorest populations by providing resources & marketing for low cost, digital remittance payments. The world's most underprivileged families often work as migrant workers. They depend on remittance payments as a lifeline for survival. RemittDAO aims to educate these families on the benefits & logistics of international digital currency transactions that are a fraction of the cost of alternative methods like Western Union. We aim to do this through marketing, field organization & grassroots social groups, and education.
