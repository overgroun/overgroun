- 👋 Hi, I’m Craig, Founder of RemittDAO
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting people with experience in DAOs 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning logistics of DAOs
- 💞️ I’m building community at RemittDAO. The goal is to educate & onboard unbanked migrant workers & asylum seekers into digital currency wallets for remittance payments. The world's most underprivileged families often consist of migrant workers & refugees/asylum seekers. They depend on remittance payments as a lifeline for survival. RemittDAO community provides support & offramps for unbanked users. This costs them a fraction of what Western Union & traditional remittance providers charge. We aim to do this through outreach, coordination, and IRL workshops.
