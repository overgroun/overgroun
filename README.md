- 👋 Hi, I’m Craig, Founder of RemittDAO
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting people with experience in DAOs 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning logistics of DAOs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a DAO called RemittDAO. The goal is to educate & onboard unbanked people groups into non-custodial wallets for digital currency remittance payments. The world's most underprivileged families often consist of migrant workers & refugees/asylum seekers. They depend on remittance payments as a lifeline for survival. RemittDAO aims to educate these families on the benefits & logistics of international digital currency transactions that cost a fraction of what Western Union & traditional remittance providers charge. We aim to do this through marketing, field organization & grassroots support groups, and IRL workshops.
